Real-time sensor data collection (temperature, vibration, pressure)

Automated control of machinery

Predictive maintenance alerts (AI/ML models on sensor data)

Remote monitoring dashboard (web & mobile apps)

Energy consumption tracking & optimization

## Prompt Pattern 2: Persona & Context

Prompt Example:
üëâ ‚ÄúHow should the system communicate insights to plant managers?‚Äù

Generated Context:

Tone: Clear, professional, actionable

Display: Dashboards with KPIs (OEE, energy usage, machine uptime)

Output Style: Visual graphs + alert notifications

Accessibility: Mobile-friendly, role-based access (operator vs manager view)

##  Prompt Pattern 3: Direct Query

Prompt Example:
üëâ ‚ÄúWhat is the current status of Machine A?‚Äù

Sample Response:

Machine A: Running

Temperature: 65¬∞C (Normal)

Vibration: Stable

Power Usage: 4.2 kWh/hr

Maintenance Status: Next check due in 120 hrs

## Prompt Pattern 4: Tabular Format Prompting

Prompt Example:
üëâ ‚ÄúCompare performance data of Machine A and Machine B.‚Äù

| Machine   | Status  | Temperature | Vibration | Power Usage | Maintenance Alert              |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| Machine A | Running | 65¬∞C        | Stable    | 4.2 kWh/hr  | Due in 120 hrs                 |
| Machine B | Idle    | 40¬∞C        | Stable    | 1.2 kWh/hr  | Overdue (Maintenance Required) |


## 5. Conclusion

This experiment shows how IoT + Embedded Automation can transform manufacturing by integrating real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and energy optimization.
